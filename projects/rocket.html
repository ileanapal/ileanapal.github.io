    <p>
        For my final year project, I designed and built a liquid-propellant rocket
        capable of controlled landing using deployable parachutes and advanced
        control mechanisms. The project involved working with high-pressure
        propellants, optimizing the combustion chamber design, and designing the nozzle.
    </p>

    <p>
        The landing system used a custom-built deployment mechanism, and my
        simulations were performed using OpenRocket and MATLAB for trajectory prediction.

    <h3>Technical Details:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Propulsion System:</strong> Liquid bipropellant engine</li>
        <li><strong>Control System:</strong> Parachute deployment with microcontroller</li>
        <li><strong>Max Altitude:</strong> ~500 meters</li>
    </ul>
