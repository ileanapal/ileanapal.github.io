        The Autonomous Tools Trolley was designed to transport equipment across an industrial workspace  
        without human intervention. Over six months I worked on conceptualizing, designing, and building  
        a smart trolley that could navigate a predefined floor plan and pick up/drop off tools at designated locations.

        The trolley operates using:  
    <p>
    </p>
        - SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping for precise movement tracking. 
    <p> 
    </p>
        - Obstacle avoidance sensors to prevent collisions.  
    <p>
    </p>
        - Autonomous pick-and-drop mechanisms for hands-free tool handling.  
    <p>
    </p>    
        The final prototype was successfully tested in a real-world environment, demonstrating smooth navigation  
        and reliable delivery of tools.
