    <h1>Final Year Project: Designing a Rocket for Autonomous Landing</h1>
</header>

<section class="project-content">
    <p>
        My final year project is focused on designing, testing, and launching a multi-stage rocket that can take off with a payload and execute controlled autonomous landing.
    </p>

    <p>
        The rocket design consists of:
    </p>
    <p>
        - <b>Two booster stages</b> to maximise the altitude achieved by the rocket
    </p>
    <p>
        - Version 1: <b>A landing engine module</b> with a directable nozzle system attached to a pressurized engine for controlled descent  
    </p>
    <p>
        - Version 2: <b>Parachute-drone hybrid</b> for precision landing without an additional engine
    </p>
    <p>
        Our work involves real-world prototype testing, simulation modeling, and iterative design improvements to compare actual flight data with predictive models.
