        The Perceptual Robotics Competition challenged teams to design and program a robot  
        that could detect and shoot a laser at dynamic targets using monocular vision.  
        Our team competed through three progressive stages, making it to the final three teams in the last round.

    <p>
        Our robot was built with:  
        - <b>Computer vision algorithms</b> for detecting and tracking moving targets.  
        - <b>PID control systems</b> for precise laser aiming and improved accuracy and hit rate.  

        The system was tested under real-world conditions, and we achieved high-speed, accurate targeting  
        using real-time computer vision feedback.
