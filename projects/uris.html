        The **URIS program** at PolyU is a competitive initiative that allows undergraduate students to engage in **PhD-level research**.
        I conducted research under **Dr. Qixin Wang** in the **PolyU Computing Department**, working on indoor UAV localization.

    <p>
        Since GPS signals are unreliable in indoor environments, we developed a **sensor fusion-based navigation system** using:
        - **IMUs**, **ultrasounds**, and **depth cameras**  
        - **Extended Kalman Filters (EKF)** for sensor fusion  
        - **Stationary updates and cloud BIM-based corrections**  

        The final results demonstrated **successful dead reckoning and localization** in complex indoor environments, significantly improving UAV autonomy.
