        In the summer of 2024, I had the privilege of attending a summer exchange
        program at the University of Cambridge, where I took advanced aerospace
        engineering courses and engaged with top researchers in propulsion systems.
    </p>

    <p>
        The courses I attended included:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Advanced Propulsion Systems</li>
        <li>Spacecraft Dynamics</li>
        <li>Astrodynamics and Orbital Mechanics</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        This exchange experience significantly shaped my academic vision and strengthened
        my commitment to sustainable space travel through advanced propulsion research.
